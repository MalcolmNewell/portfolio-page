## **About me**
I am at the University of Iowa pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and a Master of Science in Finance. 

I love baseball and finding ways to connect analytics to player development and analysis. This is why I am also a Data Analyst for the Iowa Baseball team.

I am also a TA for Principles of Microeconomics.

## **Projects**
1. B10_football_data
This project was done in Tableau. It looks at B10 football data, evaluating performances across the teams in the conference and what statistics are important for winning. We divided it into special teams, defense, and offense then offered different ways for users to explore the data/change inputs themselves at the end.

3. NCAA_March_Madness
This project was done in Python. It looks at statistics from college basketball's March Madness games. This also explored statistics that could lead to winning, predicting cinderella teams/upsets, and building models to predict how far teams will go in the tournament
