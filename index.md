## About me 
I am at the University of Iowa pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and a Master of Science in Finance. 

I love baseball and finding ways to connect analytics to player development and analysis. This is why I am also a Data Analyst for the Iowa Baseball team.

I am also a TA for Principles of Microeconomics.
